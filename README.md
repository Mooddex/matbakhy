## How It's Made:



Built using **Next.js** with **Tailwind CSS**


---

## Optimizations

- **Server-side rendering (SSR)** for SEO-friendly and fast initial load.
- **User isolation** â€“ each maker can only manage their own profile and designs.
- Ready for **image hosting integration** (e.g., Cloudinary or Firebase).
- Modular folder structure for clean scalability (pages, components, models, etc.).

- Managing complex data structures with MongoDB and Mongoose
- Implementing **authentication** and protected routes
